This folder contains all files required to create a UPPAAL
automaton. Such an automaton is a product of a finite number of
templates, and a few shared variables. Some shared functions can also
use and edit those variables.

# Comment:
This file simply contains a type to add comments in location, template
and transition. Those comments are shown to the user in Uppal's
Gui. Note that it does not deal with comments in code.

# Template
Deals with a UPPAAL template; I.e. essentially an automaton which have
to synchronize with other automata.

# C
The folder is currently unused. It was an idea I don't want to delete
immediately.
